				<h1>REWIND</h1>
				<p>Please don't roll those eyes at me, <br>because i was just trying to see are you alive inside.<br>
					On this cold dark night was it me or was it you, deep inside i wish i knew.<br><br><br>
					
					Sweet memories can we go back rewind them please,<br>
					Rewind them please.<br><br><br>

					Sometimes its hard to see <br>whats real to you what to believe,
					because I do wonder why once in a while.<br>
					Maybe if I change the lens <br>I will see I wont pretend,<br>
					This time we will sort it out theres no need to shout.<br><br><br>

					Sweet memories can we go back rewind them please,
					Rewind them please.</p>

				<h1>MAZE</h1>
				<p>There's something left to say <br>but not here in, in this way<br>
					Can we take a little time to iron it out tonight.<br>
					I don't want this to end so why do you<br> try to pretend <br>
					that you don't have the time,<br>
					To say whats on your mind.<br><br><br>

					This maze that I go through <br>made no sense till I found someone like you,<br>
					This phase that I'm going through <br>Is so much harder without you.

					Somethings up again <br>can we take some time don't try to pretend,<br>
					That you don't have the time <br>To say whats on your mind.
					I will do my best this time,<br> 
					I will make that jump, just to make you mine.<br>
					If you can open up your heart to mine.<br><br><br>
					
					This maze that I go through <br>Made no sense till I found someone like you,<br>
					This phase that I'm going through <br>is so much harder without you.

					They say what is perfect is so hard to define,<br>
					But that theory changed when you turned on my light.<br><br><br>

					This maze that I go through <br>Made no sense till I found someone like you,<br>
					This phase that I'm going through <br>is so much harder without you.</p>

				<h1>ARRIVALS</h1>
				<p>Its hard not to fake it, <br>When your away its different.<br>
				We used to talk all the time <br>And now your gone I crave it.<br>
				
				When I'm with you it feels like it should,<br>
				We didn't think we could achieve it <br>Now we can start to believe it.<br><br><br>

				You're on my mind all of the time,<br>
				Its easier to feel close to you <br>Just like it used to be.<br><br><br>

				Waiting in arrivals <br>To see your smile and I get nervous,
				It makes me think back <br>To all we have been through <br>And how much its worth it.<br>

				When I'm with you it feels like it should,<br>
				We didn't think we could achieve it <br>Now we can start to believe it.<br><br><br>

				You're on my mind all of the time,<br>
				Its easier to feel close to you <br>Just like it used to be.<br><br><br>

				It's the little moments <br>That I cant replace,<br>
				It's the little feelings <br>Like driving to your place.</p>

				<h1>FEEL IT</h1>
				<p>Sometimes is easy looking back not letting go,<br>
				How can you flick a switch and pretend not to know,<br>
				But theres something in between, something now I can see.<br>
				It's getting close, I feel a new release.<br><br><br>

				Nothing feels like the feeling of letting go,<br>
				Nothing heals like the feeling of letting go.<br><br><br>

				Pushing on through, onto something new,<br>
				If you don't have a guide just follow whats inside,<br>
				There will be a way, just take it day by day,<br>
				If you hesitate it could be too late.<br><br><br>

				Nothing feels like the feeling of letting go,<br>
				Nothing heals like the feeling of letting go.<br><br><br>

				When the pieces fall into place, and you see the time you wasted,<br>
				The space inside your mind, worrying about it all the time,<br>
				Now stepping on the cracks, looking forward not looking back,<br>
				Onto something new, a clear new view.<br><br><br>

				Nothing feels like the feeling of letting go,<br>
				Nothing heals like the feeling of letting go.<br></p>

				<h1>THE RAIN</h1>
				<p>Thinking back to memories, going to concerts when i was 18,<br>
				Where did the times go I feel much older and moving on.<br>
				Packing inside a tiny room a pair of sticks drumming on pillows,<br>
				I couldn't have asked for better days,<br>
				Listening to old cassettes that I made.<br><br><br>

				The rain comes down I need it,<br>
				For those feelings,<br>
				Yes I need them.<br><br><br>

				Surprising myself all the time back before you could post online,<br>
				the times that i spent with my friends conversations that i will never forget.<br>
				I take myself back some days if i get lost or stray to far away,<br>
				It makes it much easier when moving on,<br>
				To have those pillars i grew up on<br><br><br>

				The rain comes down I need it ,<br>
				For those feelings,<br>
				Yes I need them.</p>
